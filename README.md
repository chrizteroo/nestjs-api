**Connecting nestjs with API**

Open terminal
NOTE: you can cd to anywhere you want to create your nestjs cli

npm i -g @nestjs/cli
new veridid-api
select npm and click enter
cd veridid-api
code ..
To open vs code

navigate to src to verify the following are downloaded
app.controller.specs.ts app.controller.ts app.modules.ts app.service.ts main.ts are all available

Open terminal inside veridid-api
npm run start:dev
click enter
Note: the runs dev is in watch mode, any changes made, it will recompile instantly.

open browser and insert localhost:3000
click enter
you should see the default greetings Hello World displayed OR Note: To find local host open terminal and insert Ipconfig /all for windows and fro mac,Type /sbin/ifconfig The second way is to insert your numerical localhost and add 3000 at the end example mine"192.168.2.52.3000

Next,

stop the Hello World displayed
by pressing control c
Next,

Customize by generating modules, and new folders
nest generate module afj inside folder afj generated afj.module.ts will be available Note: do same for controller and service nest generate controller afj nest generate service afj Next,

check the app.module.ts to see if the afj module is imported
NOTE: to use the rest call copy the @Get hello from app controller and paste in Afj.controller inside the class also add to import the afjservice from afj.service and then, import the strings from app.service and paste in afj.service and also in afj.controller, import controller,Get from @nestjs/common

Once done, run npm start:dev
add /afj to localhost:3000 example localhost:3000/afj
it should be showing afj configuration example: 'Hello World from VeriDid Inc!' Note: Make sure you save your code and also refresh the browser to get the latest rendering. NOTE: Noticed {"statusCode":404,"message":"Cannot GET /test", "error":"Not Found" when trying to run nestjs on my localhost, that means your connection is slow,especially when using wireless. Solution, open main.ts inside I enabled CORS (Access-Control-Allow-Origin) setting it to true (AppModule , { cors: true}); then run again please see main.ts for all the codes

NOTE: Another note, make sure you observe the result on your terminal to identify what was mapped. Example: Added addition Call GET option test after afj, the mapped output was: Mapped {/afj/test,GET} route when checking on your browser, insert localhost:3000/afj to see aft page and,

localhost:3000/afj/test to see the test page
or better still 192.168.2.52.3000/afj 192.168.2.52.3000/afj/test Next, Building a swagger interface

stop the dev run
control c
Open nestjs documentation
go to recipes
select Swagger
open terminal
npm install --save @nest js/swagger
start up the application
npm run start:dev
scroll down on nestjs recipes swagger page to main.ts
copy form const config =new
to

SwaggerModule.setup('api', app, document);
paste in vscode main.ts
rename title,description add tags
import {SwaggerModule,DocumentBuilder} from '@nestjs/swagger';
in main.ts
Save your entries
again localhost:3000/api
Done Swagger interface is ready.

**Testing Api Calls**

In any of the 3 calls click on the dropdown arrow select try it out tab

click execute button
You should see the the responses:curl, code, response body.response headers

stop the dev run (control c)
Create additional module
nest generate module connection nest generate controller connection nest generate service connection Go to vscode and refresh connection folder containing module controller and services should be available NOTE: the easiest way is to copy files that was working and change the names example for afj.controller.ts copy and paste in connection.controller.ts and change all >the attributes to connection from afj and so on. similarly copy from constructor to return getHello in afj controller and paster in connection. controller

also,

go to afj.service.ts and copy and paste the codes example the "getHello" to connection.ts change all afj entries to connection
save
run npm run start:dev
refresh swagger interface
Result connection should be there Now we have 3 modules, APP, AFJ and CONNECTION each of which could work independently since the all contain Module, Controller, and service, this will make things easier when creating new classes. Next, we try and POST we can use it to pass info for this let use the AFJ module

in the nestjs documentation go to controllers use the cats.controller.ts examples for @POST

Overview/Controller
example: @Post("create")
return this.afjService.create;create(): string {
return 'This action adds a new name'; }
also add Post to the import in afj.service.ts

run npm run start:dev
refresh swagger
Post added to swagger api
Create Parameters by Creating a DTO class

inside the afj folder, create a folder call it dto
inside the dto folder create a file named create.dto.ts
copy example from create-cat.dto.ts and paste in the newly created file
rename it create-AFJ.dto
since we are doing Api
change strings to name, port, endpoint
Navigate to afj controller @Post to modify the calls
@Post("create")create(@Body() createAfjDto: CreateAfjDto): string {
return 'This action adds a new name'; }
run npm run start:dev
open localhost:3000/api
NOTE: this is to check the dto class entry Next:

check if the post works in swagger 62. click Post, 63. select try it out

copy name: port: endpoint:

from createdto file
paste in
POST request body as
example { "name":"Christopher", "port":8000, "endpoint":"192.168.2.41:3000", }

click execute tab
response body
This action adds new name should show
Verify if you can view the response on the console

Go to afj.controller.ts
second line on the @Post(create)
add
console.log("DTO is:", createAfjDto);
save it
and refresh complier
go to POST in swagger
Click clear Tab
Click the execute tab
NOTE: this is to run the request again navigate to terminal and check response NOTE: DTO is: {'name:'Christopher', port:8000, endpoint:'192.168.2.41:3000'} should appear.

**Putting Default into Swagger interface**

NOTE: other example uses npm install class-validator but and using nestjs specific

npm i @nestjs/class-validator
update createAfjDto file with the following data
import {ApiProperty } from '@nestjs/swagger';
import { IsString, IsInt, IsNotEmpty } from 'class-validator';
export class CreateAfjDto{ @ApiProperty({ default: 'Christopher'}) @IsString() @IsNotEmpty() readonly name: string;
@ApiProperty({ default: '8000'}) @IsNumber() @IsNotEmpty() readonly port: number;

@ApiProperty({ default:'192.168.2.41:3000'}) @IsString() readonly endpoint: string;

}

NOTE: The reason for the default value is because each properties has to be specific values as in in default value, example if a properties is a string, you cannot >put a number, or if its a name you cannot put a string as son on

NETWORKING: taking every properties will look at it later.

**Making a service call**

go to controller.ts
@POST add under return
return this.afjService.create() 87.Also copy import {CreateAfjDto} from './dto/createafj.dto and paste in afj.service.ts file
also

make a new call in the afj.service.ts
create(createDto:CreateAfjDto): string {
console.log("Service call DTO:",createDto)
return "Hello"; }
Next:

Go back to swagger api POST and execute the call
NOTE:Best Practice, configure DTO for every single call we have it is cleaner and better to understand,manage, integrate and trace.

Using Request URL in Postman 93. Open postman 94. create a new collection

example: veridid-api

add a new call example add a POST
NOTE: select Post from drop menu

paste the url address from swagger http://192.168.2.41:3000/afj/create 97.click Body and select raw, JSON 98.Navigate back to swagger and copy the JSON used example { "name":"Christopher", "port":8000, "endpoint":"192.168.2.41:3000", }
paste JSON in Postman
and

Click send
Response will be -- Hello
Adding entry to Post man request
add name to christopher to include Christopher Oladimeji
on same JSON used as example
click send and check the console in your vscode Terminal
result-- service call DTO (name:'Christopher Oladimeji',port:8000, endpoint: '192.168.2.41:3000')# nestjs-api
